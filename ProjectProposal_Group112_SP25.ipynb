    "# Our response:\n",
    "**Background Research & Prior Work**\n",
    "In the United States, lawmakers have long faced public criticism for alleged insider trading. Insider trading happens when an individual purchases or sells an asset that they own based on information that is not known to the public, often because they have access to the company's financial information or even plans. For U.S. lawmakers, this means that they have non-public information because of legislative work or committee briefings that they are a part of. They govern laws that may affect an entire industry or a subsector of that industry. To address the issues of insider trading, Congress passed the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, also known as the STOCK Act, on April 3, 2012, which requires U.S. Lawmakers to announce/show trades (buying/selling) exceeding $1,000 public information within 30–45 days of the transaction.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Despite this, it is still debated whether this act really stopped insider trading, or does it allow it to happen in plain sight. This critique encourages the debate whether the STOCK Act has actively/effectively deterred insider trading and further encourages our research question to determine if politicians are getting better ROI's on stocks related to their sectors potentially due to insider knowledge of their sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies have analyzed stock and trade data to investigate whether members of Congress consistently do better or outperform the market with their trades. Ziobrowski et al. (2011) analyzed over 16,000 transactions made by House Members between 1985 and 2001, finding that if you copied their trade portfolio, you would have outperformed the market by 6.6%.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) But more recent research by Belmont et al. (2022), which looked at all trades from January 2012 to December 2020 (post-STOCK Act) made by U.S. lawmakers, found no evidence of lawmakers having a trading advantage: buy trades underperformed the market by 26 basis points and sell trades by 11 basis points over a period of six months.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Meanwhile, Quiver Quantitative’s “Pelosi Tracker” shows that mimicking Nancy Pelosi’s disclosed trades since May 16, 2014, would have produced returns of around 720%, compared to approximately 230% for the S&P 500 over the same period.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) However, these results don’t account for trading costs, taxes, or delays in disclosure. These differences show how results can vary depending on time period, methodology, and individual lawmakers. Our project builds on this prior work by asking a more specific question, wether lawmakers perform better when trading stocks from sectors tied to their committee assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "An article by Jack Caporal from The Motley Fool looks at congressional stock trading patterns between 2021 and 2024 and shows that more than 100 members of Congress made around 10,000 stock trades per year.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) In 2024 alone, the average estimated returns were 31.1% for Democrats and 26.1% for Republicans. The most commonly traded companies were Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, JPMorgan Chase, and Palo Alto Networks. Many of these trades happened around the same time as major legislation, like the CHIPS and Science Act or the TikTok divestment bill. This raises questions about whether members of Congress may be trading from the information they have access to through their legislative work and connections. The article also highlights that members often trade stocks in industries related to the committees they serve on, like defense, health, and energy. This supports our project’s focus beucase it shows us whether politicians see stronger returns when they trade stocks related to the sectors they oversee. It also shows that there’s already public interest and growing concern about whether these trades are ethical.\n",
    "\n",
    "A study co-authored by Dinesh Hasija, PhD, who is an assitant professor of management at Augusta University, in the Hull College of Business, looked at how the stock market reacts to trades made by U.S Senators.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) The study found that investors tend to believe that members of Cngress have insider knowledge and influence over certain compainies, especially when they oversee those industries. Because of this, the market react positively when the stock trades of those members in congress are made public. And the effect is even stronger when the firm is tied to members of U.S. Senate through lobbying-sponsored legislation and politcal action committee contributions. This finding shows that the trades made by lawmakers or the members of Congress with direct oversight roles lead to bigger market reactions, which supporst our project's hypothesis: that comitte assignments might play a role in stock performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, another study by Nantiya Udomworarat, a researcher from the number one research university in Thailand and was published by the university, Chulalongkorn University in 2005.<a name=\"cite_ref-7\"></a>[<sup>7</sup>](#cite_note-7) The conducted research project aimed to discover \"the relationship between politics and stock returns in Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET).\" It was concluded that political connections typically don't lead to greater statistically significant returns in the market. However, in  support of out hypothesis, they found that \"stock returns increased 43.35% in 2003 when the firms were connected in someway to the politcal cabinet. Additionally, they found that the returns of firms who were connected to a cabinet and firms connected to politicians perform better than non-connected firms. They author also found that both \"abnormal returns of connected firms and those of non-connected firms\" tend to behave similarly regardless of the situation. Some limitations of the source includes where it was conducted (in Thailand), its age, and the fact that it concluded there was not typically a difference in returns based on politcal cabinet. However, we believe that the other findings may support our hypothesis, even in the U.S, and we aim to discover if this can be applied to different nations.\n",

    "Regarding all the concerns mentioned above, post-analysis, it should be made clear regardless of the findings that this research project should not be a guideline as to whether you should or should not follow the stock market actions of politicians… as we are not financial professionals. Furthermore, our limitations (new and old) should be made clear to readers at the beginning and end of our project to indicate where shortcomings in our data analysis could stem from. We will make it intentionally and specifically clear the aim of our project is not to determine if insider trading is occurring as a whole or at an individual level as we do not want to slander anyone. Especially considering this is purely observational data, meaning we can only infer correlation (if any) and not causation between politicians, their commitee/sector, and trading. \\\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of biases, privacy, and terms of use issues, Congresspeople are generally mandated to include investments in their financial self-reports, and are not subject to the same expectations of privacy that private citizens are. However, individual sites that we take data from may object to the use of data in a study like this, and it may be against their terms of use to scrape data from their site.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of biases in our dataset, if we are not careful about making sure our committees monitored are representative of Congress, some committees and industries may have more of a “revolving door” effect than others depending on how powerful and funded the related lobbying firms and special interests are. We already know that the Senate has a more powerful “revolving door” than the House does, so we must also balance the amount of Senate and House data such that the results are not skewed in a particular direction, leading us to over- or under-estimate the amount of correlation there is.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "We will detect biases as follows. We should have a test dataset to perform EDA on and gain an intuition about how connections in the data normally look. Then, we should analyze the similarities and differences in our test dataset and study dataset, and compare how our hypotheses differ according to these similarities and differences. Therefore, we can determine if one, or both of our datasets are skewed in some manner, as two incredibly similar datasets may indicate both are skewed, and two very different datasets may indicate one is skewed.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of data privacy and equitable impact, the main concern is of our results being co-opted for libelous means. Congresspeople are public officials and are required by law to publicly self-report their financial information, so there is not as much of a concern about data privacy. And most congresspeople are difficult to describe as “disadvantaged,” so the ability of causing equitable impact is minimized.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "We will handle isuses by checking terms of service and talk with the TAs about how to collect this data in an ethical way, and whether scraping will be permitted for this project. Also, we will make sure to collect a variety of datasets, and compare the dataset against itself and against other samples in order to determine how to construct the most representative sample.\n"
